# Cletho RAG MVP Project – Session Summary  
**Date:** 2025-08-25 & 2025-08-26  
**Facilitator:** ChatGPT  
**Participants:** Rick (Clear Thought Labs)

## 1. Next Steps

- Finalize and document the memory architecture for the Cletho RAG system.
- Design and scaffold the RAG corpus structure, including metadata tagging strategy.
- Begin draft architecture for the MVP RAG system using Supabase as the data backend.
- Establish a session journaling workflow using daily `.md` files.
- Configure persistent memory upload + retrieval pipeline using local Markdown session files.
- Define first-pass decision matrix step scripts and identify where RAG retrieval will occur.
- Explore classifiers for distinguishing user replies, user questions, and statements.
- Decide on embedding strategy for semantic search over session context.
- Discuss chunking vs summarization for RAG input construction.
- Clarify design tradeoffs between embedding raw session turns and distilled summaries.

## 2. Current Decisions

- **Session file format:** Each session summary will follow the 5-section Markdown structure.
- **Transcript inclusion:** Full session transcripts will be embedded directly in the `.md` file.
- **Working definition of “session”:** A single temporally bounded interaction, usually daily.
- **Memory boundary types:** Three are in play — Decision Cycle, Decision Step, Session.
- **RAG search methods:** Cletho’s MVP will support keyword, semantic, and metadata filtering.
- **Backend database:** Supabase selected, with emphasis on clear boundary between user vs system data.
- **Session journaling method:** Rick will upload the prior day’s `.md` file at session start.
- **Session file management:** ChatGPT will integrate past context by processing the most recent file and threading from there.

## 3. Key Previous Decisions

- **Division of system components:**  
  1. Known/standard (e.g. frontend/backend infra).  
  2. Documented/unfamiliar (e.g. RAG stack).  
  3. Novel/custom (e.g. Cletho’s decision-partnering behavior).  

- **Cletho's RAG usage:** RAG will be invoked both in response to user questions and as part of scripted Cletho prompts.

- **Embedding session context:** Leaning toward using a distilled summary rather than raw turn history for context embedding, but undecided.

- **Source corpus:** Cletho will retrieve only from curated, internal knowledge bases — no live external APIs.

---

## 4. Key RAG Design Considerations and Constraints

- Cletho, not the user, is the active agent in most query flows — requiring RAG queries to be generated internally.
- A classifier is likely needed to distinguish among user statements, clarifying questions, and RAG-triggering queries.
- Session summarization is likely needed for memory persistence and efficient semantic search.
- The retrieval corpus will include multiple types of knowledge (domain, procedural, examples) and must be tagged accordingly.
- Clear separation between user-generated data (e.g. session transcripts, decision content) and system data (e.g. BK, TK, EK) is required.
